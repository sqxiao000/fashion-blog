A deepdive look into the trends in fashion and their correlation to trends in the economy. This is a passion project :)

As a mathematical finance student, my life increasingly started to revolve around financial markets and news and the everchanging ups and downs in the ecoenomy. My interest in fashion began a lot earlier and is something that just creeped up on me. It is present everywhere in my life, in the media I consume, the clothes I wear, the hobbies I have developed. Both of these worlds are timeless global industries dating back a lot, very influential yet easily influenced at the same time.

As the economy experiences cycles and impacts, it became known that fashion trends tend to take on changes in correlation to changes in the economy. Thia relation has always existed. One of my favourite examples was the popularization of suits and workwear for women during the world wars where many men's suits were tailored to be worn by women for the first time as they joined the workforce.

Using data and current economic outlooks, I want to see what I can conclude. Will it be possible to make accurate predictions in either market to gain an advantage? What implications does this have for the future?

Over the summer, as I complete my internship, I want to focus on a few topics:
- pleated skirts - I'm wearing one as I write this
- gender-neutral clothing/masculine sihlouettes
- best-performing fashion equity
